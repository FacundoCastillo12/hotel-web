## Introduction

This hotel website was created with the aim of applying and improving my web development skills and providing an exceptional user experience. The platform presents detailed information about the hotel's rooms and services, and provides contact forms for users to easily communicate with the administrators.

To develop this website, technologies such as React and NextJS were used, and the Tailwind style library was applied to ensure maximum adaptability and responsiveness on different devices and screens. This project has been a great opportunity to learn and apply knowledge in web application development. Explore the website and make yourself at home!

**This project has been thoroughly tested to ensure its functionality**

## Features

1. Functional form with validations: The form includes validations to ensure that the fields are completed correctly before sending information to formspree.io. This ensures that the information received by the hotel is accurate and useful for the user.

2. Language selection: A language selection button has been added to allow visitors to change the language of the page to Spanish or English. This improves the user experience, as they can access content in their preferred language quickly and easily.

3. Responsive design: The website is fully responsive thanks to the use of the Tailwind styling library. This allows the page to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring that users have an optimal viewing experience regardless of the device they are using.

4. Use of modern technologies: The website has been developed using modern technologies such as React and NextJS. This ensures optimal performance and a smooth, attractive user experience.

5. Complete information about the rooms: The page displays complete information about each of the hotel's rooms, including detailed descriptions, photographs, and prices. This information is presented clearly and in an easy-to-read format, allowing the user to compare different options and choose the one that best suits their needs.

6. Complete information about the services: The page features a dedicated section for displaying the hotel's services. This allows the user to better understand what the hotel has to offer and make an informed decision about their reservation.

7.Optimized and compressed images: Images have been processed to reduce their size without compromising their quality, resulting in faster loading times for the website. Additionally, they have been converted to the WebP format, which offers better compression than traditional image formats.
